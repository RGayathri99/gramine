Users of Gramine
================

We are excited to share that several companies are experimenting with Gramine
for their confidential computing solutions. Please reach out to us at
gramine-maintainers@googlegroups.com if you are using Gramine and would like to
be highlighted on our page. We are looking forward to collaborating with you and
continue to enhance Gramine to meet the needs of your confidential computing use
cases. We will be updating this list regularly (the list is sorted
alphabetically).

- `Eder Labs <https://www.eder.io>`__ started its journey with the belief that
  businesses worldwide should easily be able to adopt ML/AI, without the
  concerns around compromising sensitive enterprise or consumer data. Towards
  this future, Eder Labs has begun facilitating exploratory data science between
  data users and data providers, for structured text data, and will be using the
  Gramine LibOS to facilitate training and deployment of models in a secure and
  federated manner, as the data science journey matures for these businesses.
  The Gramine ecosystem is laying the path to a more secure future, for all
  kinds of ML/AI applications, and Eder Labs is a firm supporter and beneficiary
  of this future-defining paradigm.

- `JD Cloud <https://www.jdcloud.com/>`__ is experimenting with Gramine for
  several solutions.

- `Tencent Cloud <https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/>`__ relies on Gramine to
  implement several SGX-based solutions by running unmodified Linux
  applications. One example is the recent launch of the Tencent Cloud
  Shuliantong product, announced at the Tencent Digital Ecosystem Summit.
